# Welcome message

Hello there! I'm Rakesh, a CS student who's also interested in Design, Economics, Psychology, Investing and Food. Why did I choose to be an CS student? Cuz' I love it! I like creating software that can automate simple tasks and make everyone's life much simpler, easier. 

As the ~~famous~~ saying goes :

> An app that looks like ðŸ’© is indeed ðŸ’©

So I tend to have a knack for decent looking design. I like to develop things iteratively. 

I'm probably doing one of these things right now:

- Playing games with my friends
- Learning something new in a programming language or economics or investing
- Binging anime
- College work ðŸ˜µ
- ~~Working on some project only to forget about it a couple days later~~
- ~~Being sad?~~
